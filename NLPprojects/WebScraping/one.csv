But then when I installed it again it malfunctioned after 3 minutes and closed automatically.I have same problem as top critical view have been shown of Kylie Adams. When I install it new New, then when Tom is in washroom or in bed, the game stops and it returns to home screen. I'm feeling very bad because of it."

 I installed this game for my granddaughter who is just learning to read. She is so frustrated with all the ads that she isn't enjoying the game. I know other players feel the same way. I've played it my self and it is definitely not fun.

" Game by itself is great. But ads are so annoying, and there are everywhere, each minute your kids are forced to see unmonitored ads! It should be illegal. I don't mind paying money to get good game for my little one. But actually I can find option to turn ads off."
 This is the worst game I have ever played. And the worst thing about it is that if you are connected to internet while playing any mini game sometimes an advertisement comes and when it is over your game closes and all the points you have collected are gone

 Worst game ever played as it doesn't meets our demand b'cuz of the mini game space trail never works when ever we wish to play it always comes connection lost please connect so why to download or play it when there is no internet connection I'm really done with it
 I paid for no ads and my child is constantly asking me to get back to the game from play store or within an ad and I have to wait until the end of the ad. I want a refund and I'm deleting
" So stupid, too many ads, wasting time and money. Developer put so many useless ads in kids game. Put your brain on, the one playing this game is a kid, why put a lot of ads in every second???? IDIOT"
 too much ads. my 3 years old son plays it. but i should wait near him because ads popping all the time and he gets angry. there is no ad free version to buy.
 Constant adverts- This game is made for children( i think) but each time you click on something adverts pop up. My child then loses interest.
 Why would you put intrusive popup ads in a game made for children?! My son cannot play the game without inadvertently clicking on a popup ad. It's ridiculous. Uninstalled
 Ads just irritate a lot and every 2nd time the mixer breaks which is very annoying and while playing games the game shuts off itself...if i had an option tp give 0 stars i would give that
 My sister said well my big sis she said when she had this game she said a few years later when I got the game in toms eyes theirs a little camera and he watches every move you make in reality that's what she said it's kinda creepy to meü§îü§îü§î
 too many ads. almost unplayable. basically 50% ads all day err day.
 Too many Ads. You Can't even play without an ad every 2 seconds.
 literally such a money grab! every few seconds pops up a 20 unskippable ad! total BS!
 Devloper l have give 1 star because l love space trails my internet connection is good. I have installed 500 MB game . Now I started to play space trials but your games Wifi connection is showing me no internet.
 Very bad. So many advertising even in the paid version.
 It keeps stopping. My child gets so frustrated. Need a fix or take this game off the shelf.
 When I download this app my phone's screen turned black. Please help me devolaper! Too much ads. When I going purchase this app it turns black .. Anybody pls help me!üôè
 Very bad...the game is so cute and adorable but lots of advertisements pops out and this is really too annoying...can't play this game for the advertisements..please take care of it..!!
 It's totally bad because of soo many ads!! I don't absolutely like it. I used to but not now.
 It is awesome but too much ads even with of internet the game bugs me to turn on the internet
 Every other tap and my kid have to watch ads. Very annoying! Developer got very greedy
 please help yourself by not buying the 'remove ads'. there are still a lot of items locked behind ads after purchased.
" I paid for the app to remove the ads, but there are still buttons popping up with ads. Very annoying"
